# Example Trip {#example-trip}

Each travel goal is specific, so along the way I'll try to give resources that will pertain to more than just a trip to this particular location. Airlines and hotels have groups, and not all tools and tips work for every destination. While this happens to be an international trip, domestic traveling is much less complicated.  Most of the tools I'll use along the way will pertain to both, but not all. You may have to search around or ask for help finding what you need. [I'm happy to help](https://twitter.com/nateritter) answer any questions you might have.

As mentioned, I'm going to plan a trip for the 4 of us (2 adults and 2 children above the age of 2) from Austin, TX to New Zealand to use as an example.
