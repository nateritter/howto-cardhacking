# Getting Started {#getting-started}

You've heard of these people who sign up for all these credit cards, get the bonus points, and travel for free. Maybe you're the kind of person who loves to travel but can't afford it (like [our family was](https://travel.perfectspace.com/europe/how-we-travelled-to-france-for-under-500-twice/)). Or, perhaps you've got a big upcoming expense and just want to make the most of what you know you're going to have to pay out.  Or you've understand the math/value and you know it makes sense but want some guidance. 

Welcome to Card Hacking!

I'm [Nate Ritter](https://nateritter.com), and I'm here to help you with the point/mile/card hacking game, playing within the rules for the long term, with the goal of earning (almost) free travel now and for years to come.  I've been doing this for almost a decade, and I feel it's time to pay it forward and help others learn how to do it too.

## What is Card Hacking? {#what-is-card-hacking}

There are many names for what this is - churning, card/point/mile/travel hacking, and more - and there are many nuances or sub-niches of it like manufactured spending. At a very basic level, however, it is taking advantage of the credit card company bonus point offers by applying for these credit cards and earning the points or miles offered. More broadly, we mean simply maximizing credit card and travel rewards.

Now that you know what it is, and it probably seems obvious why you'd **want** to do it you should also know [why you should **NOT** card hack](/docs/when-not-to-card-hack).
