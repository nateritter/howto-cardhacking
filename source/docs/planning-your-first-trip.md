# Planning Your First Trip {#planning-your-first-trip}

Planning is essential. If you're already yawning, go back and read [why you should not card hack](/docs/when-not-to-card-hack).  Otherwise, let's get on with planning how to do your first application. 

It all starts with what your travel goals are.

Start by listing...

1. Where you want to go
2. How you want to get there
3. Who you want to go with
4. And how long you want to stay

With that information, the tools I'll share with you will become extremely valuable.

Since everyone's goals are different it's probably most helpful to use an example. The best example I have right now is my own family's travel goals, so here's what we'll do: I'm going to plan a trip for the 4 of us (2 adults and 2 children above the age of 2) from Austin, TX to New Zealand.  [Tilly](https://retreats.tillyritter.com) (my wife) visited back when she was in 7th grade and wants to return. I have always dreamt of experiencing it as well, so that'll be our example trip.  

Now that we have our example travel goal, let's [figure out how we're going to get there](/docs/example-trip).

> Disclaimer: This was written in early 2019. Things change. This is going to be an example and I'll try to keep it updated and generic enough to be applicable for as long as possible. If you see something is outdated, please [let me know](https://twitter.com/nateritter).
