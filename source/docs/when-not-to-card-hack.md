# When NOT to Card Hack {#when-not-to-card-hack}

> I'm going to pretty much steal this straight from Reddit's [/r/churning](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/8m487c/why_you_should_not_begin_churning_v30/), modified slightly. /r/churning is a great resource for when you've become more advanced, though. So feel free to bookmark it for later.

Card hacking is not without it's risks. The credit card companies allow us to play this game because, like a casino, they are betting you will make a mistake and the odds are in their favor because we're all human.  Unlike casinos, we are allowed to count cards and use tools to assist us.  But their gamble is that you'll carry a balance with interest and/or pay the annual fees in excess of what you're able to convert the points/miles into as a travel expense.

Applying for credit cards also reduces your credit score, temporarily.  If you are applying for mortgage, car loan, job, apartment, or other situation that requires a credit check, it's a good idea to stop all churning as far in advance as possible (at least 2 years ahead of time is a good goal).  Generally speaking, though, your credit score dips 3-4 points for every card you apply for for about 3 months or so.  If you are a savvy consumer (not paying interest by keeping a balance and paying your bills on time) you may find credit scores even get better than they were before you started card hacking.

In some situations homeowners insurance rates can be impacted by card hacking / churning.  Even though your credit score may be high and your credit utilization may be in good standing, your insurer could do soft pulls on your credit and may increase your rate if there a lot of new credit lines.

## Don't card hack if you have a history of running up monthly debt

The APRs, strict penalties, and generous credit lines can really poison even the most financially sound minds. If you have a history of late payments, carrying a balance, or have just never held a credit card before and are unaware of the temptations of having an easily accessible $5,000 sitting around, I highly recommend you sit on the sidelines. 

## Don't card hack if you have a long-standing relationship with a bank and want to keep it

Some banks can and will ban people who sign up for too many cards, even if it's not that bank's cards.  If your primary checking account is with one of the big banks, you automatically need to tread carefully before jumping in.

As time goes on, banks will get better at determining who the churners/hackers are and continue to ban them.  We are not a profitable segment.  So, if you have a valuable relationship with big banks, card hacking is likely not for you.

## Don't card hack if you are unorganized with personal finance

Keeping track of all the things you need to keep track of when you do this with more than just a couple cards gets crazy. Spending requirements ($ and time), annual fees, bonus categories, where and when to transfer points/miles, due dates, etc.  Miss a payment and it could affect your credit history and your ability to continue card hacking. 

If you aren't good at writing things down the moment they happen, keeping a long audit of all your paperwork, adn ensuring you have time to update your curren status, card hacking / churning is probably not for you.

## Don't card hack if you don't know how you'll meet your minimum spend requirements

Remember, you should not be keeping a balance, so if you don't know that you can meet your spending requirement on a card, you shouldn't be applying for the card in the first place.  

## Don't card hack if you don't have a travel goal

Your best value is to pick a city, see which airlines fly there (and have the best availability), and plan your card applications to ensure an enjoyable journey and stay.  We'll walk you through this, but if you don't have a goal, wait until you have one.

## Don't card hack if you have a credit score less than 725

Yes, you can do it with less, but you'll likely struggle and put your financial well being at risk. Use a card you already have. Make on time payments. Establish a nice long credit history with a couple banks. Come back when you've proven you're responsible both to yourself and the banks.

## To sum up...

Please re-read this page and understand these risks. Your credit is not something you should mess around with lightly. If you're unsure, don't do it. If you're hesitant, don't do it. If you don't have the money to pay off cards and keep a zero balance, don't do it. If you're a compulsive spender or shopper, don't do it. 

If, and only if, you understand all the risks presented here and in the terms of every credit card offer you apply for before you apply for them, and it still makes sense, you still are excited by the opportunity and you are confident in your ability to stay organized, then let's [prepare to do this right](/docs/planning-your-first-trip)
